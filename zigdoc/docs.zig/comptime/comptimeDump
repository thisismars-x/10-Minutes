compile time is better than runtime

langs with a super dynamic runtime pay the price of
performance for over simplification
.zig does not have a runtime(traditional sense)

stuff known @compile time give aggressive 
optimization opportunities to the compiler

	 |--> Runtime: unpredictable	
language |
	 |

	 |--> Comptime: very predictable


.zig, rust, all have very simple runtimes
languages like Java, Python(specially interpreted)
langs have a very dynamic runtime
